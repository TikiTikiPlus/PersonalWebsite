            <p>
            Hello There! I am a Software Engineering graduate at Waikato University, looking to secure a full-time position in Software Engineering. 
            I have a good understanding of Programming, Data Analysis, Networking, Cloud, Defensive Cybersecurity, and Pentesting due to my experiences from hobbies 
            and different university papers. Iâ€™m a team player, energetic, and enjoy learning new things to broaden my skillset.
            I also have programming experience in Python, Java and C#.
